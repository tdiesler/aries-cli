# Aries CLI Reference 

After [installing](./guides/getting-started.md) the Aries CLI, you can run `aries-cli` to see all the options available to you. This overview will walk you through everything step by step and show you how to use the Aries CLI in your development process. 

If you'd rather explore functionality through the CLI yourself, just use the `--help` or `-h` flag on any of the subcommands to see more info.

## Usage

The Aries CLI distinguishes options and subcommands. Options before the subcommands are global, options after the subcommands are specific to that subcommand. 

```sh
aries-cli [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```



## Configuration

After installation, the default xxxx is config met de community agent. You can also see an empty API value. 


```sh
aries-cli configuration initialize
```
